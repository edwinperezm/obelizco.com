## Current Issue: Node.js Version Mismatch
Netlify is failing to build due to an incompatible Node.js version. The current configuration is trying to use Node.js 22, which isn't fully supported yet.

### Solution:
1. Update .nvmrc to use Node.js 20 (LTS)
2. Update package.json engines field
3. Test build locally with Node.js 20
4. Push changes and trigger new Netlify build
